Beyond\nrealistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual\nperception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still\nremains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging\nvisual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to\ncomprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular\nVeo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including\nspatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically\ncharacterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,\nwe curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables\nin-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our\nfindings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning\npatterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and\nlocally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal\nreasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are\nnot yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging\nsigns as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.\nProject page: https://video-cof.github.io",

In this work, we report the\nformation of a spin polaron in a context that doesn't fall cleanly into either\nof these paradigms. In particular, we study the one-dimensional Mielke-Tasaki\nchain, a paradigmatic model of flat band ferromagnetism, which has an exact\nferromagnetic ground state, trivial band topology, and quenched kinetic energy\nin its lowest band. Despite these features, our density matrix renormalization\ngroup simulations reveal the presence of spin polarons upon electron doping\nthis model. More surprisingly, combining these numerics with analytic\ncalculations, we show that polaron binding occurs when the interaction-induced\nkinetic energy of the model is zero -- contrary to intuition from kinetic\nmagnetism -- and the glue binding the electrons and spin-flips arises from weak\nmixing with the model's dispersive band -- contrary to what occurs in\ntopological flat bands.

For reflection-based readout, we leverage\nthe spin-dependent cavity reflection contrast to generate the qubit readout\nsignal. We show that the cavity reflection approach enables high-fidelity spin\nreadout even when the T center only has a modest cyclicity. With realistic\nsystem parameters, such as cavity quality factor $Q = 2\\times10^5$ and T center\noptical linewidth $\\Gamma/2\\pi = 100$ MHz, we calculate a single-shot readout\nfidelity exceeding 99% within 8.7 $\\mu$s for both spin readout protocols.",

Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a\npromising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce\nimmersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance\nthis technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically\nbased rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to\nrepurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,\nand PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize\nappearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we\npresent OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and\nefficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for\na broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,\ngeneration, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic\npanorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse\nindoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene\ngeneration, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic\nvirtual world generation.",

Such information is\nnow being measured for dozens of planets with state-of-the-art facilities using\nBayesian atmosphere retrievals. We collect measurements of exoplanet\ncomposition of gas giants into a Library of Exoplanet Atmospheric Composition\nMeasurements for comparison on a population level. We develop an open-source\ntoolkit, ExoComp, to standardize between solar abundance, metallicity, and C/O\nratio definitions. We find a systematic enhancement in the metallicity of\nexoplanets compared to T-dwarf and stellar populations, a strict bound in C/O\nbetween 0 and 1, and statistically significant differences between measurements\nfrom direct, eclipse, and transmission spectroscopy. In particular, the transit\nspectroscopy population exhibits a systematically lower C/O ratio compared to\nplanets observed with eclipse and direct spectroscopy. While such differences\nmay be astrophysical signals, we discuss many of the challenges and subtleties\nof such a comparison. We characterize the mass-metallicity trend, finding a\nslope consistent between planets measured in transit versus eclipse, but offset\nin metallicity. Compared to the Solar System and constraints from interior\nmodeling, gas giant atmospheres appear to exhibit a steeper mass-metallicity\ntrend. We hope that the tools available in ExoComp and the data in the Library\nof Exoplanet Atmospheric Composition Measurements can enhance the science\nreturn of the wide-array of space- and ground-based exoplanet science being\nundertaken by the community.",

Let\n\\(p=p(n)\\)\nbe a function of\nn\nsuch that\n\\(0<p<1\\)\n. Let\n\\(\\widehat{G}_n(p)\\)\nbe a random mixed graph with\nn\nvertices in which all arcs are chosen independently with probability\np\n(and an edge is regarded as two oppositely oriented arcs joining the same pair of vertices). In this paper, we study the spectral properties of the normalized Hermitian Laplacian matrices of the random mixed graphs\n\\(\\widehat{G}_n(p)\\)\nfor large\nn\n. We characterize the limiting spectral distribution of the normalized Hermitian Laplacian matrices of random mixed graphs. In fact, under the case that\n\\(p \\in (0,1)\\)\nand\n\\(np/\\ln ^{4}n\\rightarrow \\infty \\)\n, we prove that the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of the normalized Hermitian Laplacian matrix converges to the semicircle law.\nThis is a preview of subscription content,\nlog in via an institution\nto check access.\nAccess this article\nLog in via an institution\nSubscribe and save\nSpringer+\nfrom €37.37 /Month\nStarting from 10 chapters or articles per month\nAccess and download chapters and articles from more than 300k books and 2,500 journals\nCancel anytime\nView plans\nBuy Now\nBuy article PDF 39,95 €\nPrice includes VAT (India)\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nInstitutional subscriptions\nExplore related subjects\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\nComplex Networks\nGraph Theory\nGraph Theory in Probability\nLinear Algebra\nStochastic Networks\nFunctional Analysis\nData Availability\nAll data supporting this study are openly available.\nReferences\nL.

Let\n\\(p=p(n)\\)\nbe a function of\nn\nsuch that\n\\(0<p<1\\)\n. Let\n\\(\\widehat{G}_n(p)\\)\nbe a random mixed graph with\nn\nvertices in which all arcs are chosen independently with probability\np\n(and an edge is regarded as two oppositely oriented arcs joining the same pair of vertices). In this paper, we study the spectral properties of the normalized Hermitian Laplacian matrices of the random mixed graphs\n\\(\\widehat{G}_n(p)\\)\nfor large\nn\n. We characterize the limiting spectral distribution of the normalized Hermitian Laplacian matrices of random mixed graphs. In fact, under the case that\n\\(p \\in (0,1)\\)\nand\n\\(np/\\ln ^{4}n\\rightarrow \\infty \\)\n, we prove that the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of the normalized Hermitian Laplacian matrix converges to the semicircle law.\nThis is a preview of subscription content,\nlog in via an institution\nto check access.\nAccess this article\nLog in via an institution\nSubscribe and save\nSpringer+\nfrom €37.37 /Month\nStarting from 10 chapters or articles per month\nAccess and download chapters and articles from more than 300k books and 2,500 journals\nCancel anytime\nView plans\nBuy Now\nBuy article PDF 39,95 €\nPrice includes VAT (India)\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nInstitutional subscriptions\nExplore related subjects\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\nComplex Networks\nGraph Theory\nGraph Theory in Probability\nLinear Algebra\nStochastic Networks\nFunctional Analysis\nData Availability\nAll data supporting this study are openly available.\nReferences\nL.

Existing video-to-4D methods\ntypically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive\nand brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches\nmitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera\ntrajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby\ndepicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this\ntrajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene\ndynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a\npose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory\nprediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby\nseparating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video\ninpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising\nrealistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing\nregions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D\nannotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal\nautoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and\nextends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at\nbounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation\nand sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and\nqualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and\nimproved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,\nadvancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.",

The most\nintriguing question is about the nature of the normal state: is the Cooper pair\nformed from small Fermi surface or large Fermi surface? In this work we point\nout the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets,\ndubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $\\nu=-2-x$, there is a\ntwo-component picture: two electrons mainly localize on the AA sites and form a\npaired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon,\nwhile additional holes form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to\nan intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and violates the perturbative\nLuttinger theorem. We develop a unified framework to describe both a\nrenormalized Fermi liquid (FL) and an sFL phase. We propose that the normal\nstate of the TBG superconductor is the sFL phase, but it evolves toward the FL\nphase under increasing hole doping. The superconducting phase emerges from the\nsFL phase by transferring pairing of local moments to the mobile carriers.\nInterestingly, the superconducting gap can exhibit a nematic nodal\n$p_x$-pairing symmetry. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first unified\ntheory that explains both the pseudogap metal above $T_c$ and the two-gap\nnematic superconductivity below it.",

PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty\nover linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise\nshifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that\nTransformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on\nunseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published\nclassical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up\nto $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.\nSurprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can\nbe reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented\ntogether during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying\nstructures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with\nmodulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for\nnear-perfect prediction grows as $\\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization\nenters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \\geq\n2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating\na critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding\nlayers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously\ngroups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,\nrevealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.",

In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most\nnotably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization\nin modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can\nleverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework\nthat systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key\npillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that\nintegrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions\nfrom web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen\nmodels. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion\ntriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose\nViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from\nMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance\nefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that\neliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong\ngeneralization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed\nfor fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and\ngeneralization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human\nevaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.",

One standard mechanism for constraining decaying\ndark matter from 21-cm observations relies on heating of the intergalactic\nmedium by the decay products, an effect whose observability is entangled with\nthe uncertain Lyman-$\\alpha$ fluxes and X-ray heating from the first stars. In\nthis Letter, we explore a novel mechanism, where the Lyman-$\\alpha$ photons\nproduced from dark matter decay initiate early Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the\nspin temperature to the gas temperature, thereby boosting the 21-cm signal.\nThis mechanism provides constraints on dark matter that are less dependent on\nuncertainties associated with star formation than constraints on exotic\nheating. We study this effect for decaying dark matter with masses\n$m_{\\chi}\\sim20.4-27.2$ eV, where diphoton decay efficiently produces\nLyman-series photons. We present forecasts for the Hydrogen Epoch of\nReionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array, showing their potential to\nprobe an unconstrained parameter space for light decaying DM, including\naxion-like particles.",

Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log\ndata into structured log data, is often the first step in automated log\nanalysis. Given the wide range of log parsers utilizing diverse techniques, it\nis essential to evaluate them to understand their characteristics and\nperformance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study\ncomparing syntax- and semantic-based log parsers, as well as single-phase and\ntwo-phase parsing architectures. Our experiments reveal that semantic-based\nmethods perform better at identifying the correct templates and syntax-based\nlog parsers are 10 to 1,000 times more efficient and provide better grouping\naccuracy although they fall short in accurate template identification.\nMoreover, two-phase architecture consistently improves accuracy compared to\nsingle-phase architecture. Based on the findings of this study, we propose\nSynLog+, a template identification module that acts as the second phase in a\ntwo-phase log parsing architecture. SynLog+ improves the parsing accuracy of\nsyntax-based and semantic-based log parsers by 236\\% and 20\\% on average,\nrespectively, with virtually no additional runtime cost.",

In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and\nthe regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the\nbalancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction\nterm, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,\ncovariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating\nthe balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE\nin the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is\nin a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for\nconstructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term\nbecomes zero.

However, existing vision-language models\n(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract\nfine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also\nhinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel \"ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)\" to provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting\ntabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various\nattributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON\ntemplate to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically\ntailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference\nworkflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and\ncompare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on\nseveral recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,\nweaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These\nfindings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart\nunderstanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened\nin current models.",

Using causal mediation analysis on\na diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of\nattention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of\nthe filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate\nthat this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted\nand reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,\npresented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also\nidentify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for\nfiltering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing\nthis intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our\nresults reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable\nimplementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways\nthat are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional\nprogramming patterns.",

          "abstract": "A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.\nGiven past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the\nembodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.",

The main\noutcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection\nframework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the\nmulti-class segmentation of different AMD lesion types in non-invasive RGB\nfundus images. The source code used to conduct the experiments presented in\nthis paper is made freely available.",

The energy dependence of the two-point correlator, called the\ndipole amplitude, is governed by the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation. The\ninitial condition for the BK equation can be fitted to the experimental data,\nwhich requires evolving the dipole amplitude for a large set of different\nparameter values. In this work, we train a transformer model to learn the\nenergy dependence of the dipole amplitude, skipping the time-consuming\nnumerical evaluation of the BK equation. The transformer predicts the learned\ndipole amplitude and the leading order inclusive deep inelastic scattering\ncross section very accurately, allowing for efficient fitting of the initial\ncondition to the experimental data. Using this setup, we fit the initial\ncondition of the BK equation to the inclusive deep inelastic scattering data\nfrom HERA and consider two different starting points $x_0$ for the evolution.\nWe find better agreement with the experimental data for a smaller $x_0$. This\nwork paves the way for future studies involving global fits of the dipole\namplitude at leading order and beyond.",

Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

However, with this form of energy come challenges related to the release of radiation that can have potentially hazardous effects on humans and the environment alike, requiring an array of safety and security measures to minimize the release of radiation itself, and radioactive materials in general. A basic understanding of the physics and the chemistry of nuclear power and as well as a systematization of various technologies and their functioning is necessary to understand the energy sector—including the military sector.\nThis chapter provides a simplified introduction, first to the physics and chemistry of the atom, radiation as well as the different types of chain reactions (Sect.\n2.2\n), and then introduces various types of reactors (Sect.\n2.3\n) that have been tried, tested, operated, and sometimes were also abandoned. In addition to nuclear fission, i.e., the splitting of atoms, we also present the physics of nuclear fusion and the most important research activities in that field Sect.\n2.4\nconcludes.\n2.2\nNuclear Physics and Chemistry\n2.2.1\nNuclear Forces and the Atom\nThe following section introduces the terminology of and around the atom to provide a rudimentary understanding of the underlying processes allowing the operation of fission and fusion devices for energy production. The information presented here is based on Neles and Pistner (\n2012\n) and Yim (\n2022\n).\n2.2.1.1\nFour Forces\nEvery performed action can be traced back to one of the four fundamental forces or interactions. While the gravitational and electromagnetic forces are observable in everyday actions, the weak and strong nuclear forces apply only on a sub-atomic level.\nGravitation is the force of attraction between all particles that have mass. Although the force itself is relatively weak, it has an unlimited range, making it responsible for forming large structures such as galaxies, stars, and planets.\nThe electromagnetic force arises from the electric charge of particles. It can be either attractive or repulsive due to different electric charges. This force is responsible for the chemical behavior of atoms and molecules. It also has an infinite range.\nThe strong nuclear force acts on the subatomic level and is responsible for binding nuclei consisting of positively charged particles that would—if the electromagnetic force were stronger—repulse each other.\nThe weak nuclear force applies only to the subatomic level and is responsible for radioactive decay.\n2.2.1.2\nThe Atom\nAtoms are the building blocks of material. In general, they consist of three types of particles:\nElectrons are negatively charged.\nProtons are positively charged.\nNeutrons have no charge.\nNon-ionized atoms have the same number of electrons and protons and, therefore, are neutrally charged. Protons and neutrons, collectively known as nucleons, are concentrated in the center of the atom, the nucleus. These particles make up most of the atomic mass and weigh approximately one amu (atomic mass unit, ≈1.6605 × 10\n–27\nkg). The electrons “circulate” around the nucleus and are practically weightless (Fig.\n2.1\n). In reality, however, they are better described as electron clouds.\nFig. 2.1\n(\nSource\nOwn depiction derived from Yim [\n2022\n, 53])\nThe structure of the atom\nFull size image\n2.2.1.3\nThe Periodic Table and the Actinides\nThe elements of the periodic table are differentiated by their number of protons (Fig.\n2.2\n). Hydrogen (H) has one proton and one electron, helium has two of each, while uranium (U) has 92 protons and electrons. The number of protons is referred to as the atomic number Z. The mass of an atom is determined by the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The sum of both is given in the mass number A. For a given element, the number of neutrons can vary between atoms.\nFig. 2.2\n(\nSource\nTaken from Wikimeadia\nFootnote\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Colour_18-col_PT_with_labels.png\n, accessed on 08–10-2024.\n)\nPeriodic table of the elements\nFull size image\nVersions of elements with different mass numbers are referred to as isotopes. Thus, isotopes are distinguished by the mass number. For example, the nucleus of a regular hydrogen atom consists of only one proton; it is therefore called H-1. The hydrogen isotope deuterium (H-2) has an additional neutron, doubling the mass. Another isotope is tritium (H-3) that has two extra neutrons. Other examples are U-235 (uranium isotope with 143 neutrons) or U-238 (uranium isotope with 146 neutrons).\nIn the context of nuclear fission energy, the actinides, i.e., elements with 89–102 protons, play an important role (Fig.\n2.2\n). Naturally occurring actinides are uranium and thorium that can be used for large-scale nuclear fission. There are two groups of actinides that can be distinguished in reactor physics:\nTransuranic elements: actinides with atomic numbers greater than 92 (uranium) are called transuranic elements. These elements are a result of the neutron capture process during the operation of nuclear fission reactors, where a neutron hits a U-238 atom, which then transforms into transuranic elements such as Neptunium-239 and Plutonium-239 via two beta decays (see Eq. (\n2.1\n)).\nMinor actinides: elements that are typically produced in small amounts during the operation of nuclear reactors. These include isotopes such as neptunium, americium, and curium.\n$${}_{92}^{238} U + {}_{0}^{1} n \\to {}_{92}^{239} U\\to {}_{93}^{239} Np + \\beta^{ - } \\to {}_{94}^{239} Pu + 2\\beta^{ - }$$\n(2.1)\n2.2.1.4\nMasses and Binding Energy\nSince the strong nuclear force has a relatively short range, it primarily causes attraction between nucleons in close proximity. This means that the strength of this bond is largely independent of the overall size of the nucleus. However, the binding energy of nucleons within the nucleus is also influenced by electromagnetic interaction. As the number of protons in the nucleus increases, their mutual repulsion becomes larger due to their positive charge. The combination of both the strong and the electromagnetic force within the nucleus has two implications:\nThe first effect is the resulting binding energy per nucleon. Initially, as the number of nucleons increases, the strength of the binding also increases (Fig.\n2.3\n). This leads to a maximum in binding energy per nucleon at the nucleus of Fe-56 (iron). Consequently, Fe-56 is the most tightly bound nucleus with the optimal binding energy. The binding energy per nucleon is lower for both lighter and heavier nuclei.\nFig. 2.3\n(\nSource\nAdapted from Wikimedia\nFootnote\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.jpg\n, accessed on 13-11-2024.\n)\nNuclear binding energy\nFull size image\nThe second effect is a shift in the neutron-to-proton ratio in the nucleus. As nuclei become heavier, electromagnetic repulsion rises, and the binding energy per nucleon decreases again. In light nuclei, optimal binding occurs when there is an equal number of protons and neutrons, resulting in stable nuclei. In nuclei with many protons, the repulsion between nucleons increases. For instance, the neutron-to-proton ratio in C-12 (carbon) is exactly one, while for the isotope U-235, the ratio is 1.55, meaning that for this uranium isotope, there are 55% more neutrons than protons in its nucleus. There are two types of nuclear reactions, described by Nuttall (\n2022\n, 239) as follows: “Fission obtains energy through the splitting of large heavy atoms [into smaller ones], while nuclear fusion produces far greater levels of energy through the joining together of small light atoms.” The difference of energy released from either reaction is related to the nuclear binding energy that is the energy of the electric force subtracted from the value of the strong force. This results in the phenomenon known as the mass defect. For fission, the combined mass of the large atom and the neutron is slightly larger than the combined mass of the new nuclei and fission neutron. For fusion, the combined mass of smaller atoms is slightly larger than the combined mass of the fusion products. The released energy can thus be calculated using Albert Einstein’s most famous formula (Eq. (\n2.2\n)):\n$$\\Delta E = \\Delta m{*}c^{2}$$\n(2.2)\nwith ∆m being the difference in mass after fusion or fission (in amu) and c the speed of light (≈298,000 km/s)\nFigure\n2.3\nalso provides an intuitive differentiation between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. The difference between the reactions is shown by the difference in binding energy when moving along the elements, either from left to right (fusion), or right to lef",

Other examples are U-235 (uranium isotope with 143 neutrons) or U-238 (uranium isotope with 146 neutrons).\nIn the context of nuclear fission energy, the actinides, i.e., elements with 89–102 protons, play an important role (Fig.\n2.2\n). Naturally occurring actinides are uranium and thorium that can be used for large-scale nuclear fission. There are two groups of actinides that can be distinguished in reactor physics:\nTransuranic elements: actinides with atomic numbers greater than 92 (uranium) are called transuranic elements. These elements are a result of the neutron capture process during the operation of nuclear fission reactors, where a neutron hits a U-238 atom, which then transforms into transuranic elements such as Neptunium-239 and Plutonium-239 via two beta decays (see Eq. (\n2.1\n)).\nMinor actinides: elements that are typically produced in small amounts during the operation of nuclear reactors. These include isotopes such as neptunium, americium, and curium.\n$${}_{92}^{238} U + {}_{0}^{1} n \\to {}_{92}^{239} U\\to {}_{93}^{239} Np + \\beta^{ - } \\to {}_{94}^{239} Pu + 2\\beta^{ - }$$\n(2.1)\n2.2.1.4\nMasses and Binding Energy\nSince the strong nuclear force has a relatively short range, it primarily causes attraction between nucleons in close proximity. This means that the strength of this bond is largely independent of the overall size of the nucleus. However, the binding energy of nucleons within the nucleus is also influenced by electromagnetic interaction. As the number of protons in the nucleus increases, their mutual repulsion becomes larger due to their positive charge. The combination of both the strong and the electromagnetic force within the nucleus has two implications:\nThe first effect is the resulting binding energy per nucleon. Initially, as the number of nucleons increases, the strength of the binding also increases (Fig.\n2.3\n). This leads to a maximum in binding energy per nucleon at the nucleus of Fe-56 (iron). Consequently, Fe-56 is the most tightly bound nucleus with the optimal binding energy. The binding energy per nucleon is lower for both lighter and heavier nuclei.\nFig. 2.3\n(\nSource\nAdapted from Wikimedia\nFootnote\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.jpg\n, accessed on 13-11-2024.\n)\nNuclear binding energy\nFull size image\nThe second effect is a shift in the neutron-to-proton ratio in the nucleus. As nuclei become heavier, electromagnetic repulsion rises, and the binding energy per nucleon decreases again. In light nuclei, optimal binding occurs when there is an equal number of protons and neutrons, resulting in stable nuclei. In nuclei with many protons, the repulsion between nucleons increases. For instance, the neutron-to-proton ratio in C-12 (carbon) is exactly one, while for the isotope U-235, the ratio is 1.55, meaning that for this uranium isotope, there are 55% more neutrons than protons in its nucleus. There are two types of nuclear reactions, described by Nuttall (\n2022\n, 239) as follows: “Fission obtains energy through the splitting of large heavy atoms [into smaller ones], while nuclear fusion produces far greater levels of energy through the joining together of small light atoms.” The difference of energy released from either reaction is related to the nuclear binding energy that is the energy of the electric force subtracted from the value of the strong force. This results in the phenomenon known as the mass defect. For fission, the combined mass of the large atom and the neutron is slightly larger than the combined mass of the new nuclei and fission neutron. For fusion, the combined mass of smaller atoms is slightly larger than the combined mass of the fusion products. The released energy can thus be calculated using Albert Einstein’s most famous formula (Eq. (\n2.2\n)):\n$$\\Delta E = \\Delta m{*}c^{2}$$\n(2.2)\nwith ∆m being the difference in mass after fusion or fission (in amu) and c the speed of light (≈298,000 km/s)\nFigure\n2.3\nalso provides an intuitive differentiation between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. The difference between the reactions is shown by the difference in binding energy when moving along the elements, either from left to right (fusion), or right to lef",

By utilizing an effective potential method, we investigate the paths of particles, innermost stable circular orbit, and behavior of photon spheres, which connects them to the appearance of black hole shadows. Thermodynamic features such as Hawking temperature and entropy are studied for investigating the effect of <jats:italic>L</jats:italic> and thermal fluctuations on the stability of black holes. These discoveries connect theoretical ideas with observational astrophysics, which enhances our comprehension of ordinary black holes in AdS models. In this study, we analytically compute the greybody factor for a massless scalar field propagating in the vicinity of a black hole under the assumption of weak coupling to gravity. We investigate the behavior of the effective potential concerning the black hole's mass and charge, revealing that it reaches its maximum at lower values of the cloud of strings parameter. Our results indicate that the radial absorption rate of the scalar field exhibits significant fluctuations, which is influenced by the charge of the black hole and clouds of string, with implications for the dynamics of scalar fields in strong gravitational fields.</jats:p>",
