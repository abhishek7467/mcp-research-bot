A key challenge facing current non-contact detection technologies using\nmillimeter wave (mmWave) radar is the low efffciency of multi-channel signal\nfusion in array radar systems based on equal weighting. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes a vital sign enhancement detection method for\nmultiple input and multiple output (MIMO) bio-radar, driven by multidimensional\nphysiological characteristics, which overcomes traditional limitations through\na two-stage fusion strategy. Stage 1: Enhanced Vital Sign Detection Using\nSingle-Channel Signals Based on Physiological Characteristics. First, a chest\nwall multi-scattering point model is constructed.

A key challenge facing current non-contact detection technologies using\nmillimeter wave (mmWave) radar is the low efffciency of multi-channel signal\nfusion in array radar systems based on equal weighting. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes a vital sign enhancement detection method for\nmultiple input and multiple output (MIMO) bio-radar, driven by multidimensional\nphysiological characteristics, which overcomes traditional limitations through\na two-stage fusion strategy.

For single channel\ntime-distance two-dimensional echo signals, effective range bins are selected\nbased on the respiratory/cardiac physiological frequency band energy ratio, and\nthe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of respiration/heart signals is enhanced using\nphase-aligned maximal ratio combining (MRC).

This score is calculated from the Modified Base\nScores collected over the past hour. The resulting Total Score - the sum of the\nModified Base Score, Threat Score, and Environmental Score - is used as the\nmain indicator for real-time system classification and forecasting of\ntransitions from InC to OutC. This ant colony optimization-inspired approach\nprovides an adaptive and interpretable framework for process monitoring and\npredictive maintenance in industrial environments.",

First, explicit\nretrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden \"tool tax\" of extra tokens and\nsteps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging\nacross all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework\nthat combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its\nfoundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,\nintegrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of\nthis substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates\neach candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware\nIterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's\nLast Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\\% accuracy -- the\nhighest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4\npoints and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously\nreducing token usage by 53.5\\% and agent steps by 43.7\\%. Results on SuperGPQA\nand TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning\nfailures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\\% of cases, while diversity\nanalysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution\nvariety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings\ndemonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the\ninefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation.

          "text": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on\nscientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit\nretrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden \"tool tax\" of extra tokens and\nsteps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging\nacross all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework\nthat combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its\nfoundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,\nintegrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of\nthis substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates\neach candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware\nIterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's\nLast Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\\% accuracy -- the\nhighest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4\npoints and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously\nreducing token usage by 53.5\\% and agent steps by 43.7\\%. Results on SuperGPQA\nand TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning\nfailures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\\% of cases, while diversity\nanalysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution\nvariety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings\ndemonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the\ninefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation.

COBRA combines slithering and tumbling locomotion to adapt to\nvarious crater terrains. In snake mode, it uses sidewinding to traverse flat or\nlow inclined surfaces, while in tumbling mode, it forms a circular barrel by\nlinking its head and tail, enabling rapid movement with minimal energy on steep\nslopes.

While rovers\nhave been used to explore the lunar surface for decades, they face significant\nchallenges in navigating harsh terrains, such as permanently shadowed craters,\ndue to the high risk of immobilization. This report introduces COBRA (Crater\nObserving Bio-inspired Rolling Articulator), a multi-modal snake-style robot\ndesigned to overcome mobility challenges in Shackleton Crater's rugged\nenvironment. COBRA combines slithering and tumbling locomotion to adapt to\nvarious crater terrains. In snake mode, it uses sidewinding to traverse flat or\nlow inclined surfaces, while in tumbling mode, it forms a circular barrel by\nlinking its head and tail, enabling rapid movement with minimal energy on steep\nslopes. Equipped with an onboard computer, stereo camera, inertial measurement\nunit, and joint encoders, COBRA facilitates real-time data collection and\nautonomous operation. This paper highlights COBRAs robustness and efficiency in\nnavigating extreme terrains through both simulations and experimental\nvalidation.",

          "abstract": "The development of multicomponent hydrogels has gained a lot of attention in\nthe field of soft matter, as precise tuning of the chemical nature and\ncolloidal properties of each component brings mechanical and functional\nbenefits compared to one-component gels. Within the field, orthogonality\nbetween a self-assembled low-molecular weight gelator (LMWG) and a colloid is a\ndomain that has received little attention. In this study, orthogonal\nLMWG-colloid hydrogels were developed with the additional constraint of\nsustainability: a bolaamphiphile glycolipid (G-C18:1) is selected as LMWG while\ncellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as colloid. These compounds are chosen for their\ndual role. G-C18:1 is a LMWG but it can also be used, at lower concentrations,\nas surface stabilizer for CNCs and tune its aggregative properties. On the\nother hand, tuning surface properties of CNCs drives its bulk behavior:\nuncharged CNCs locally aggregate and act as reinforcing agent for the LMWG gel,\nwhile negatively-charged CNCs, cross-linked with Ca 2+ , naturally form a\nhydrogel, which can interpenetrate with the LMWG network. By means of\nrheometry, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and rheo-SAXS, it is shown here\nhow the aggregative behavior of CNCs enhances the mechanical properties of\nG-C18:1 hydrogels, while G-C18:1 imparts pH and temperature responsiveness to\nCNC hydrogels. An interesting field of research in soft matter science is the\ndevelopment of orthogonal hydrogels containing cellulose and LMWGs, although,\nto the best of our knowledge, there are no existing reports. Since cellulose is\namong the most extensively studied macromolecules in the field of soft matter,\nparticularly for biomedical applications, 22,23 developing and studying the\nproperties of orthogonal hydrogels containing CNCs and a LMWG represents an\nintriguing avenue for research, and this for two reasons. First of all, CNCs\nare bio-based nanoparticles, relevant for the development of sustainable\nnanoscale science and engineering. Secondly, the surface chemistry of CNCs can\nbe controlled in such a way to tune their aggregation and dispersion\nproperties, making them interesting either as reinforcements in hydrogels,\n24,25 or as hydrogel scaffold themselves. 26,27 These aspects were never\nexplored in the context of orthogonal hydrogels. In this work, we then study\northogonality in fully bio-based hydrogels composed of a single glucose lipid\nLMWG (G-C18:1) and CNCs. G-C18:1 is selected for its multiphasic behavior in\nwater at room temperature 28 and linked to its unique surfactant-lipid-gelator\nnature, 28,29 tuned by pH and/or type of ion. Below neutral pH and at\nconcentrations under 5 wt%, G-C18:1 forms vesicles, displaying a lipid-like\nbehavior. At pH above neutrality, it assembles into micelles, thus exhibiting a\nsurfactant behavior. 30,31 When Ca 2+ is added to its micellar phase, 32,33\nG-C18:1 forms fiber gels 30 (Figure 1). In particular, we focused on orthogonal\nG-C18:1/CNC hydrogels, in which CNCs either assembled into hydrogels\n(negatively-charged and cross-linked by calcium ions, referred to as SCNCs,\nFigure 1) or behaved as reinforcing agents (uncharged CNCs prepared via HCl\nhydrolysis, referred to as CNC$\\alpha$, and neutral surface stabilized by\nG-C18:1, 34 Figure 1). These two types of CNCs exhibit distinct roles in the\nhydrogel system: SCNCs actively participate in the formation of a percolated\nnetwork, while CNC$\\alpha$ are used to reinforce the hydrogel matrix\nphysically. Specific attention is paid to the impact of the assembled form of\nCNCs to the elastic properties of the LMWG hydrogel as well as how the\nresponsivity to pH and temperature of the LMWG affect the elastic properties of\nCNC hydrogels. 33",

Levy is considered to have\nprovided the first significant solution to this problem in 1884, and most\nstability text-books make reference to this original solution, which is based\non the Euler-Bernoulli beam model. Following this incipit, over the past one\nhundred and forty years a huge number of papers have continued to analyse many\nspecial cases and extensions. However, the majority of these studies tend to\nbuild on the a-priori assumption of inextensibility of the ring centre line\nwithout investigating the real significance and extent of this condition. Here,\nin the framework of a suitable non-linear kinematic, the problem is re-examined\nfrom its roots, and it is shown that not only the inextensibility paradigm\ncannot straightforwardly lead to the classic solution in an energy framework,\nbut, on the contrary, the extensibility of the ring is necessary to allow a\nunified and meaningful treatment of buckling and initial post-buckling\nbehaviour for a complete variety of cases. On these bases, some facts and\nresults in literature are rectified and discussed.",
